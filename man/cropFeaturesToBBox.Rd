\usage{
cropFeaturesToBBox(obj, bbx)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{\itemize{
\item object of class "sf" or "sfc"
}}

\item{bbx}{\itemize{
\item object that can be converted to a sf:bbox (see details)
}}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item object of same type as \code{obj}, but cropped to the bbox limits
}

\description{
Function to crop features (a \code{sf::sf} or \code{sf::sfc} object) to a bounding box.
}
\details{
\code{bbx} can be any object that can be converted to a \code{sf::bbox}
using \code{getBBox}.
}
\note{
The bounding box must be in the same coordinate system as \code{obj}. If the
coordinate reference system for \code{bbx} is undefined, it is assumed to be the same as
that for \code{obj}.
