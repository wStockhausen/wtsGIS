\description{
Function to determine the names of the \pkg{sf} geometry column(s) in a dataframe.
}
\details{
The input dataframe does not have to be a simple features (\pkg{sf}) dataframe
(i.e., one with class = "sf") to contain \pkg{sf} geometry columns. For example, a
\pkg{sf} dataframe (class = "sf") with multiple geometry columns on which \code{\link[sf]{st_drop_geometry}} is ca
is called will have the "active" geometry column dropped and the resultant class will be
"tbl_df", but the other geometry columns (those that were not the active one) will not have been dropped.
